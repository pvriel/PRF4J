/**
 * Class representing <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/972639.972643">Naor-Reingold PRF functions</a>.
 * <br>This implementation is more generic compared to the original definition of the NR-PRF functions:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Three keys are being used here. The initialKey is equal to a_0 from the original definition.
 *     The a0 key array contains the exponents that are used for the active bits of the elements, and therefore
 *     are equal to a_1, a_2, etc. . The a1 key array contains the exponents that are used for the non-active
 *     bits of the elements (in the original definition, these exponents were replaces with ones).</li>
 *     <li>During a computation, the result of the exponent product is replaced with (exponent product) mod q.
 *     This allows for faster computation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>Therefore, the computation of the NR-PRF functions occurs as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The computation of the exponent product starts with the value initialKey. For every active bit at index i of the provided
 *     element, the current value of the exponent product is multiplied with a0[i]; otherwise, a1[i] is used.
 *     After every multiplication, the product is adjusted to modulo q.</li>
 *     <li>The exponent product is used as an exponent for the generator (== result).</li>
 *     <li>The computation returns result mod p.</li>
 * </ol>
